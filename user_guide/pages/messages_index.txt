The messages section is where you can send private messages to members of the crew. Nova has received some major upgrades when it comes to private messaging. We've taken the idea of private messaging and really brought it to where it should be. Nova's private messaging includes the ability to send to multiple people simultaneously as well as the ability to forward, reply, and reply all.

From the inbox, you can see all messages you have received (your inbox) as well as all the messages you've sent (your outbox). When you have a new private message, a small green icon will appear to the left of the subject. Clicking on the the subject will take you to that message. If the message is unread, navigating to it will clear the unread flag in the database. You should never see the unread icon in your outbox since you composed all those private messages.

Clicking on the Write New Message link at the top of the page will open the page to compose a new private message to someone.

Clicking on the checkboxes and clicking remove will set the message's flag to n, meaning you will not see the message in your inbox/outbox again. While the message has not been deleted, there is no way to recover the message to your inbox/outbox without the game master manually going in to the database. Use caution when removing items from your inbox/outbox!

In order to access all the private messaging features, a user need only have messages/index privileges.
