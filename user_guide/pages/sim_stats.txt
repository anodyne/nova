| SIM - STATS
|
| System Version: 1.0
|---------------------------------------------------------------

The sim stats gives a snapshot of the statistics for the current month and the last month of sim activity. Nova tracks statistics for players, characters and non-playing characters.

POSTS
==========

Mission posts, personal logs and news items are tracked for the current month and the previous month. All three types of posts are calculated for the month from 12:00:00 AM on the first day of the month to 11:59:59 PM on the last day of the month. Nova has a post count format which decides if a post counts on its own or if it's counted for as many times as there are authors. This only affects mission posts. Post count format options are multiple or single.

AVERAGES
==========

Averages are calculated on the fly for users for the current month and previous month. Nova takes the total number of mission posts/personal logs and divides that number by the total number of players. It's important to note that averages are for players, not characters. The last average is the total number of mission posts and personal logs divided by the total number of players.

PACE
==========

Nova attempts to calculate based on totals for the current month what the total number of mission posts and personal logs would be. Pace is determined by dividing the number of posts in the month by the number of elapsed days, then multiplying by the number of days in a given month. Actual end of the month numbers may vary from pace estimates.
