|---------------------------------------------------------------

The contact page is meant to be used by people outside the sim to contact the various people they might need to contact. The list includes the game master, the webmaster, and the command staff. Selecting game master from the list will send the email to any member of the crew who is set as a game master. Likewise, selecting the webmaster option will send the email to any member of the crew who is set as a webmaster. Finally, selecting command staff will send the email to every member of the crew who's position is listed as a senior position. By default, this includes the CO, XO, and all department heads. Additional positions can be added to the list by setting them to a type of senior from the positions management page.

The email and message fields are required to send the form. If they are not filled out, the form will fail and an error will be returned.

Once all the information is entered and the user clicks Submit, the form will be sent to the recipient they requested and a confirmation message will be displayed.

WARNING! If system email is turned off, this form cannot be delivered to the game master(s). Because of this, when system email is turned off, the submit button on the page is disabled to prevent the form from being sent.
