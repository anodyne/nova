Personal logs can be anything from a log (like a diary/journal) entry about what they're thinking or anything else going on in their lives. It's also gives a good opportunity to show a character's history as well. The game master can also choose to use personal logs for other things as well. If you have questions, you should contact your game master about how they think you can best use personal logs.

Personal logs consist of an author, a subject, content, and any tags you want to put on your log for it to be easily found in a search later on. You can post a personal log as your main character or any other character or protected non-playing character associated with your account. All associated character will be in the dropdown menu. If you only have one character, it will just display the character's name.
