| PERSONNEL - CHARACTER BIO
|
| System Version: 1.0
|---------------------------------------------------------------

The character bio page contains each character's biographical information. From the character bio page, any piece of information about the character can be seen. In addition, registered users who are logged in will also have access to the character's player bio which will display information about the player who plays that character. No player personal information is provided on the character bio page.

BASIC INFO
==========

At the top of the character bio page is a collection of the most basic information about the character: name, rank, position, and an image. If there is more than one image associated with the character, clicking on the image will open the gallery of images in a lightbox. In addition to the basic information, there are links to view all posts, logs and awards for that character. More information about those features can be found on their respective pages. When a user is logged in, an additional link will display to the player biography.

DATABASE GENERATED CONTENT
==========

Nova uses a highly dynamic database schema for storing and retrieving character information, allowing game masters to customize the join/bio form to anything they want. All dynamic database content is displayed below the basic information. By default, Nova breaks the information up into separate tabs. From the manifest settings though, these can be changed to use more tabs, fewer tabs, or no tabs at all. Each tab is then broken up into sections. Sections can be added or removed or even moved to other tabs from the manifest settings. Drilling further down, fields are just as dynamic and can have their ordered changed or even moved to other sections. Fields must be associated with a section; you cannot just associate a field with a tab. More information is available about manifest customization in the manifest settings section of the user guide.
