Online RPGs rely heavily on written materials to give players a sense of the world they're inhabiting. Nova makes it easy to do that with the tour feature. Built like the join/bio form, portions of the tour page are driven by the database, allowing game masters to add fields to their tour items with little hassle.

By default, visiting the tour page will show a list of tour items whose display flags are set to yes. The name of the tour item is also a link to a more detailed page. Additionally, a brief summary is found to the right of the title.

TOUR ITEM DETAIL
==========

Clicking on the name of the item opens the tour item detail page. This page gives a complete glance at the tour item. The brief summary a user just saw on the listing of tour items is shown at the top followed by any images that have been set for the item. Like other places in Nova, multiple images can be set and will create a simple Lightbox gallery of the images.

The Additional Information section is driven entirely from the database. These are the fields you can create wider descriptions as well as any other information you may feel is pertinent for the players to know. You can edit Tour fields through the Tour Fields Management page. Tour items themselves can be edited through the Tour Management page.
