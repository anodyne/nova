| SITE MANAGEMENT - BIO SECTIONS
|
| System Version: 1.0
|---------------------------------------------------------------

To avoid pages of information without any rhyme or reason, Nova uses sections to break up relevant information into groups to make biographies easier to read and the join page to make more sense. Sections, like tabs, are built on the fly from the database, meaning they can be changed to whatever you want through a simple interface.* If you want a section that doesn't have a title (for instance, if there is only one section in a tab), you can accomplish this by setting the section's name to a blank field.

ADDING A SECTION
==========

Clicking the Add Bio Section link will open a pop-up window and let you create a brand new section, including its name, order and what tab it's a part of. Sections must be associated with a tab, they cannot be outside a tab. Once you've filled out the information, click submit at the section will be added to the database and available to put fields inside.

DELETING A SECTION
==========

If you decide that you don't want one of the sections that comes with Nova or one that you created, you can delete them by clicking on the delete icon in the table on the bio sections management page. You will be presented with a pop-up window verifying that you want to delete the section as well as a dropdown menu. Because sections have fields inside them, you need to select a new section so Nova can move those fields from the section you're deleting to the new section to avoid orphan data in the database. This ensures that players will still have access to fields even if you remove a section. Click Submit and Nova will delete the section and return you to the bio section management page.

UPDATING A SECTION
==========

You can update a section's name, order and which tab they're associated with by clicking on the Edit icon in the table on the bio sections management page. You will be given a pop-up window with fields populated with the current data. Change the values to what you want then click Submit and Nova will update the section. If you don't want the section to use a header, simply leave the name field blank.

* For character biographies, Nova uses fields, sections and tabs. Fields can only be put inside sections, they can't be put into tabs without a section. Sections can only be put inside tabs, they can't be put anywhere but in a tab. Tabs cannot be put inside anything.
