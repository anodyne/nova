| MESSAGES - READ
|
| System Version: 1.0
|---------------------------------------------------------------

The read messages page allows you to read a specific private message. You are only allowed to read private messages that you have written or are a recipient of. If you attempt to read a private message you are not authorized to, you will be redirected to an error page. This is done for obvious privacy reasons and cannot be overwritten. Third-party developers are strongly discouraged from changing this behavior!

The title of the page is the subject of the private message you are viewing. Below that is a link that will take you back to your inbox. Below the link back to your inbox is the basic information you may want to know about the private message, including when it was sent, who sent it, and who else received the private message. After the horizontal rule is the content of the private message.

Below the content are three links: reply, reply to all, and forward. These three links allow you to respond to the private message in their respective ways. A reply will only be sent to the person who sent you the private message. A reply to all will be sent to all the recipients of the private message plus the author. A forward will allow you to forward that private message to someone else.

In order to access all the private messaging features, a user need only have messages/index privileges.
