| AUTO-LOADER
| -------------------------------------------------------------------
| This file specifies which systems should be loaded by default.
|
| In order to keep the framework as light-weight as possible only the
| absolute minimal resources are loaded by default. For example,
| the database is not connected to automatically since no assumption
| is made regarding whether you intend to use it.  This file lets
| you globally define which systems you would like loaded with every
| request.
|
| -------------------------------------------------------------------
| Instructions
| -------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| These are the things you can load automatically:
|
| 1. Libraries
| 2. Helper files
| 3. Plugins
| 4. Custom config files
| 5. Language files
| 6. Models
