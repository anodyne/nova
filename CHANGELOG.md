- Update Site Bans to use the current timestamp when a ban is created.
- Update the database driver to MySQLi by default. (This will only apply to new installations.)

- Update Mail class to allow for SSL or TLS over SMTP.
- Update posting flow to prevent unnecessary locking when saving a mission post

## [2.4.9] - 2017-03-08
### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where the installer would throw an error on certain server setups.

## [2.4.8] - 2017-01-25
### Changed
- Updated the Nova database to allow for mission posts, personal logs, and news items of more than 65,000 characters.
- Updated the behavior of replying to a private message from your own sent messages. Previously, it would reply to yourself, but now will reply to the original recipient. (Thanks to Williams for this update!)
- Updated how Nova handles incrementing the version number in hopes of mitigating the "0.0.0" database version issue.

## [2.4.7] - 2017-01-07
### Changed
- The saved post links in the Writing Control Panel have been updated to favor the "view" mode instead of "edit" mode. This should prevent posts from being unnecessarily locked when users are just trying to read saved posts.
- The post, log, and news posting pages have been updated with back buttons to make navigation easier.

## [2.4.6] - 2016-08-28
### Changed
- We've updated the gender identification selections on new installations to be more in line with social conventions. Hermaphrodite has been replaced with Transgendered/Intersex and Neuter has been replaced with Agendered/Non-Binary.

### Fixed
- We've made some changes to the email class in the hopes of reducing the number of errors people are starting to see.
- Addressed an error with assigning departments to a manifest.

## [2.4.5] - 2015-11-14
### Changed
- Addressed potential issue for users who are running MySQL with strict SQL mode. This would oftentimes result in a cryptic "1364 error" during installation or update, but it could also occur in other areas of the system. Thanks to Jon Matterson for his work on this issue!
- Update the new Mail class with attempts to validate the email addresses. If they're empty or not valid email address, they'll be stripped out of the recipient list.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where a user could update their character without a name. Either the first or last name is now required to update the character.

## [2.4.4] - 2015-09-04
### Changed
- Updated Nova to indicate when anything less than PHP 5.3 is on the server. Due to changes in Nova 2.4, there is now a requirement of PHP 5.3.

### Fixed
- Fixed wrong link to the Inbox from Sent Messages.

## [2.4.3] - 2015-08-11
### Added

## [2.4.2] - 2015-08-08
### Fixed
- Fixed errors when sending emails to multiple recipients.

## [2.4.1] - 2015-08-07
### Fixed
- Fixed error thrown with missing method that was removed in the latest version of CodeIgniter 2.

## [2.4.0] - 2015-08-07
### Added
- Created a new `Mail` wrapper class around SwiftMailer for better email handling than CodeIgniter's built-in email class. Thanks to forum user TheDrew for helping us sort through some of these issues.
- Added a notice to the bottom of all emails that it's an automated email and they shouldn't reply to the message.

### Changed
- Updated the controllers with the new Mail class calls.
- Updated the manifest Javascript to remove hard-coded calls to a table structure. This has become problematic as people have begun to modify the manifest to have less traditional layouts.
- Updated the error language file with a new error message.

### Removed
- We've removed all the reply-to calls with emails since more and more spam filters are checking the reply-to headers as well as the from header.

### Fixed
- When there is no manifest metadata, an extra space is displayed.
- Fixed issue where users could view pending and saved mission posts, personal logs, and news items from their respective view pages.

## [2.3.2] - 2014-05-10
### Changed
- Updated the email from the contact form and the email to the GM from the docking form to include recipient information. Despite the name and email address are in the headers, we're including those as well as the sender's IP address.
- Updated the included head files to allow for using Nova on a secure domain.

### Fixed
- Fixed wrong language key being used for the word "sim" in a couple of places.

## [2.3.1] - 2014-02-02
### Fixed
- When toggling open positions, any open positions in sub-departments would throw off the display of the entire manifest.

## [2.3.0] - 2013-09-14
### Added
- Admins can now add inline help for any dynamic form field to help users filling the forms out. The content will be shown below the label and above the field.
- Nova now shows a link back to All Characters when editing a character (if the user has permission).
- Nova now shows a link back to All Users when editing a user (if the user has permission).
- Admins can now specify additional metadata from the bio form to be dispalyed under the character name on the manifest (such as species, gender or any other field).
- Sim stats now shows some statistics for the total life of the sim.

### Changed
- When displaying the output of a dynamic form, if there's nothing in the field, we no longer show it.

### Fixed
- If a character didn't have any posts, their bio would display the start of UNIX time instead of nothing.

## [2.2.3] - 2013-04-07
### Fixed
- Some users have reported errors being thrown during the update process that prevent them from moving up to newer versions of Nova. We've attempted to create a fix for this, but since we haven't been able to recreate the issue, this may or may not work.

## [2.2.2] - 2013-03-27
### Fixed
- Fixed error thrown when managing NPCs. (Thanks to evshell18 for the fix and pull request.)
- Fixed issue where users without `wiki/categories` permissions couldn't create or edit wiki pages. ([#239](https://github.com/anodyne/nova/issues/239))

### Added
- Added reply to header to most of the emails that are sent from Nova. ([#217](https://github.com/anodyne/nova/issues/217))

### Changed
- Update author listings to provide links to each character's bio page. Thanks to Jordan Jay for his MOD to do this. We've expanded on his idea to provide this functionality for mission posts, personal logs, news items, wiki pages and comments. ([#223](https://github.com/anodyne/nova/issues/223))
- Updated the characters model to allow retrieving specific field information by ID or field_name. ([#216](https://github.com/anodyne/nova/issues/216))

- A missing closing tag on the character bio management page caused display problems.
- When upgrading from SMS, system administrators didn't have the proper flags set.
- When using the personal logs RSS feed, the link to the entry went to the view post page, not the view log page. ([#234](https://github.com/anodyne/nova/issues/234))

## [2.1.3] - 2012-11-05
### Fixed
- Restoring lost functionality on some pages due to the security vulnerability update. ([#215](https://github.com/anodyne/nova/issues/215))

## [2.1.2] - 2012-11-04

- Update to jQuery UI 1.8.24.
- Update to markItUp! 1.1.13.
- Update to CodeIgniter 2.1.3.
- Update Nova to address a security issue.

### Fixed

- Once a docking field is turned off, the only way to turn it back on is by going in to the database and changing the display value. ([#214](https://github.com/anodyne/nova/issues/214))
- Any spec form field that is turned off has no indication that it's disabled.
- Any tour form field that is turned off has no indication that it's disabled.

## [2.1.1] 2012-09-12
### Changed
- Update to CodeIgniter 2.1.2.
- Update to jQuery 1.8.1.
- Update to jQuery UI 1.8.23.
- Update the IP Address fields in the database to be compatible with IPv6 addresses.

### Fixed
- During the update process, Nova never updated the system information table with the correct version number.
- Despite the system version and components database tables being pulled out, the What's New menu item was never removed, throwing a 404 error if someone tried to go to the page.
- The Admin Control Panel's update notification panel doesn't properly display all the language strings because the proper language file wasn't loaded.
- The user bio page had debug code from 2.1 development at the top of the page.
- Under some circumstances, unlinked NPCs had a link to a user bio that threw an error.
- The User Not Found error was missing a parameter (would show %s instead of the word 'user').

## [2.1.0] - 2012-06-26
### Added
- Users are now notified when mission notes have been updated in the last 72 hours by the notes box auto-expanding when they arrive at the posting page.
- Users are now shown when the last update to the mission notes was all the time.

### Changed
- Update the Version Information page to reflect the database changes.
- Update the post, log, and news creation pages to give a description of what tags are meant to be used for.
- Update to jQuery UI 1.8.20 (we now include the entire jQuery UI library for anyone who wants to use components we don't use).
- Update to prettyPhoto 3.1.4.
- Update to jQuery Reflection 1.1.

### Removed
- Remove the `count_unread_pms` method from the private messages model. (This method was deprecated in Nova 2.0.)
- Remove the `system_components` and `system_versions` tables from the database. There's really no reason to be maintaining these lists in Nova. Instead, users who are interested in Nova's components and version history should visit AnodyneDocs.
- Remove the What's New page for the reasons specified above.
- Remove jQuery library from the file system. We now pull jQuery from a CDN instead of storing it locally.

### Fixed
- The update page would always throw an error that it couldn't find Nova installed in the current database.
- When a mission was updated, it was assumed mission notes updated as well. Now, there's greater precision in determining if the notes were actually updated.
- Accepting or rejecting docking applications would throw a fatal error because the Messages model wasn't loaded before it was used.
- Join timespan always showed as a user joining "1 Second ago" no matter when they joined.
- Nova's `timespan_short` helper was missing the word "ago" when the time was less than an hour.
- The Site Messages page didn't strip HTML tags from the content potentially allowing unclosed HTML tags to wreak havoc on the page.

## [2.0.3] - 2012-03-01
### Changed
- Updated jQuery UI to version 1.8.18.

### Fixed
- Benchmarking psuedo-variables are not handled properly because of the fact the Template library doesn't not use the Output library for sending content to the browser.
- When saving posts with the Post Participants feature turned off, Nova would throw errors about a database field not accepting NULL values.

## [2.0.2] - 2012-02-09
### Added
- Added some code to try and make the mission post locking auto-release a little smarter.

### Removed
- Removed the social interaction tools from prettyPhoto image modals. ([#169](https://github.com/anodyne/nova/issues/169))

### Fixed
- Under some (strange) circumstances, Nova could throw errors from the Ajax controller.
- A typo in the language string on the reset password page when the security question you select doesn't match what's in the database.
- If a user has multiple playing characters assigned to them, the milestones listing would display their main character name for every playing character they had assigned to them instead of just displaying it once.
- The new manifest layout has some display issues when using sub departments. ([#168](https://github.com/anodyne/nova/issues/168))
- When updating the content of a deck, the submit process went back to the select screen instead of staying on the current item's page.
- When deleting specification items, if there are decks associated with that spec item, they're orphaned and not deleted.
- The Who's Online listing displayed random spaces and commas.
- Character image galleries duplicated the primary image.

## [2.0.1] - 2012-02-04
### Fixed
- If the user's screen isn't wide enough, the tooltip on the Writing Control Panel that displays the post lock information can slide partially out of view.
- Nova tried to load a language file through an object that couldn't see it, resulting in an error thrown about the file not being found.

## [2.0.0] 2012-02-04
### Changed
- Site Messages can now contain previously disallowed HTML tags (like `embed`, `iframe`, etc) for adding media from YouTube and Vimeo to site messages (like the welcome message) without needing to use seamless substitution.
- Mission groups can now be added inside other mission groups (nesting only allowed one level deep).
- Users with Level 2 user admin access rights can now reset someone's password for them. The new password will be generated and emailed to the user and they'll be prompted to reset the password the next time they log in. At no time does the user with Level 2 user admin access rights see what the newly generated password is. ([#16](https://github.com/anodyne/nova/issues/16))
- Multi-author posts are now locked during editing to prevent users editing the same post at the same time. The lock is released after the user saves their changes or they've gone 5 minutes without making a change. (In the event a user has changed something and walked away, their changes will be saved to the post first.)
- Admins now have the option of showing the latest personal logs and mission posts on the main page. (Admins will be able to select any combination of news, logs and posts.)
- Admins now have the option of setting the top open positions (from Position Management) that will be shown at the top of each manifest (not manifest-specific).
- Added a rules page to the main section that can be updated from the Site Messages page.
- The instructions on the upload page now include the maximum file size and maximum image dimensions (pulled from the upload config file) for reference to anyone uploading images. ([#143](https://github.com/anodyne/nova/issues/143))
- The deck listing page now uses a table-less layout for a cleaner look.
- The deck listing page now has a menu of decks at the top of the page for quickly moving to a deck item without having to scroll. (We think RPGs with a lot of decks are going to love this!)
- Overhauled the user interface for mission groups to provide more information (and look a lot better too).
- When composing a mission post, the dropdown will now show who owns a linked NPC.
- When composing a mission post, personal log or private message, users only have to start typing a name and the options will be narrowed down for them. ([#23](https://github.com/anodyne/nova/issues/23))
- The skin catalogue now allows removing an entire skin (with sections) and letting admins choose which skin users will beupdated to for each section.
- The user account page now has options to make activating and deactivating users a lot easier.
  - When deactivating a user, all active characters associated with that account with also be deactivated.
  - When activating a user, admins will be prompted about which of the user's inactive characters should be reactivated.
- The character bio page now has options to make activating and deactivating characters a lot easier.
  - Activating an inactive character (and all related actions) can now be done with the push of a button.
  - Deactivating an active character (and all related actions) can now be done with the push of a button.
  - Making an NPC an active character (and all related actions) can now be done with the push of a button.
  - Making a character an NPC (and all related actions) can now be done with the push of a button.
- When viewing a character's posts, the entries will be paginated to help with load times and usability.
- When viewing a character's logs, the entries will be paginated to help with load times and usability.
- Site manifests can now store default view information so that different manifests can have different view settings. (This is now handled through Site Manifest management instead of Site Settings.) ([#157](https://github.com/anodyne/nova/issues/157))
- Gave the Pulsar skin a refreshed look and feel.
- Gave the Titan skin a refreshed look and feel. (If you're interested in changing the header image, please see Titan's README.md file for instructions.)
- The Writing Control Panel now shows a notification for any entires that have been commented on in the last 30 days (along with a link to the comments section of the entry).
- The manifest has been reorganized (for the first time ever) with a slightly different look.
- The email sent to the game master when a user applies now goes to anyone who can approve or reject character applications.
- Acceptance and rejection emails now CC in anyone who can approve or reject character applications.
- Users can now search within their sent and received private messages.
- Private messages have now been split in to separate inbox and sent message pages. This will help improve performance since the page doesn't have to load all the messages at once then split them off in to tabs.
- Private messages in the inbox and sent messages list are now paginated.
- The Reply to All link when reading a private message is only displayed if there's more than one recipient.
- The Reply, Reply to All and Forward options when reading a private message are now displayed above and below the private message.
- Users can now mark all unread private messages as read with a single click.
- An all-new redesigned character bio page provides a better, cleaner user experience.
- Moved to CodeIgniter 2.1 (was previously 1.7.3).
- Moved to a brand new file structure that further removes the Nova Core from any changes an admin might be making.
- Added **experimental** module support.
- Updated to jQuery 1.7.1.
- Updated to jQuery UI 1.8.17.
- Updated to jQuery Uniform 1.7.5.
- Updated to jQuery prettyPhoto 3.1.3.
- Updated to markItUp! 1.1.12.
- Added the jQuery Chosen plugin.
- Added the Bootstrap by Twitter Twipsy plugin (version 1.4).
- Added the Bootstrap by Twitter Popover plugin (version 1.4).
- Removed the qTip plugin. (Please use the Bootstrap Twipsy plugin instead.)
- Changed the `banned.php` file to `message.php` that now contains notifications of Level 2 bans, a missing `nova` directory and incompatible PHP version information.
- Seamless substitution can now be used to override email view files from the `_base_override` directory.
- Added seaQuest DSV as a genre option. ([#144](https://github.com/anodyne/nova/issues/144))
- Changed the Location helper into a library with static methods (`Location::view` instead of `view_location`).
- Removed the RSS model. (It isn't necessary since most of the calls were duplicated in the appropriate post type models.)
- Added constants to the Access model for the default access roles.
- The Missions model now allows group missions to be pulled from `get_all_missions()`.
- The Missions model now has a method to count mission groups: `count_mission_groups()`.
- The Users model now has a method to pull all of a user's LOA records: `get_user_loa_records()`.
- The Auth library now uses static methods to be able to call quicker (`Auth::check_access()` instead of `$this->auth->check_access()`).
- Nova will always check for the existence of the database config file. If the file isn't found, Nova will enter a new config setup wizard that will walk admins through setting up the config file, test the connection and then write the file for them.
- The SMS Upgrade process will now migrate SMS Database entries to the Thresher wiki page format.
- Completely re-wrote the upgrade process to not use config files (admins select the components they want upgraded through a user interface), to show more useful validation messages and be a shorter, more pleasant process (reduced the number of steps from 14 to 4).
- View files now check for the existence of the BASEPATH constant before rendering. On some servers, random `error_log` files are generated all over the place. A big part of this is view files that are accessed apart from the framework and generate PHP fatal errors. This fix should help eliminate those error log files.
- In preparation for future deprecation, we've removed all references to jQuery's `.live()` method. Third party developers should ensure their own code is updated as soon as possible to avoid any issues once the method is removed from the jQuery core.
- Changed the way users manage categories when creating and editing a wiki page. ([#137](https://github.com/anodyne/nova/issues/137))
- Users with the proper permissions can now create categories when creating and editing a wiki page. ([#64](https://github.com/anodyne/nova/issues/64))
- If there are no categories set in Thresher and the user has the proper permissions, they will be prompted to create some new categories when creating and editing a wiki page.
- Changed the user experience for managing wiki pages that puts more controls at the user's disposal and simplifies the entire page. ([#141](https://github.com/anodyne/nova/issues/141))
- Changed the user interface for viewing wiki pages to make it simpler.
- Users must have Level 1 wiki page access to see the page history now.
- Only users who are logged in can see comments on a wiki page.
- Added system pages to Thresher that allow some of the system pages to have their content changed like a normal wiki page. ([#123](https://github.com/anodyne/nova/issues/123))
- Users can now search Thresher from the main Thresher page.
- Fixed several bugs with the listing of Thresher search results.
- Removed the recently changed and recently updated listings from the main Thresher page.
- Users can now subscribe to an RSS feed for created wiki pages as well as updated wiki pages.
- Admins can now restrict access to a wiki page based on access role. ([#11](https://github.com/anodyne/nova/issues/11), [#12](https://github.com/anodyne/nova/issues/12))

### Fixed
- Seamless substitution of images wouldn't work when the images were in the `_base_override` directory.
- The `RE:` and `FWD:` tags would be added to private message subjects when replying and forwarding indefinitely until there was no space left for the actual subject line. Now, Nova will make sure it's only added once. ([#158](https://github.com/anodyne/nova/issues/158))
- When replying to a private message, the author of the message would be added to the recipient list, so any message they send would also show up in their inbox as well. (This behavior can be duplicated by manually adding themselves to the recipients list.)
- The join form could be submitted without an email address or password.
- Users who were deactivated kept their account flags (system administrator, game master, webmaster) and their access role. Now, all account flags and access roles are changed on deactivation.
- Users who were reactivated didn't have their access role set to Standard User.
- Inactive users were shown a link in the sub-navigation to upload an image even though they don't have permissions to upload images.
- A password could be reset for a user even if they don't have a security question chosen.
- Patched several potential security and access issues.
- Positions weren't properly updated when deleting an active character.
- Pulsar styling issues in Internet Explorer 9.
- Titan styling issues in Internet Explorer 9.
- When viewing character or user award, the "Nominated By" line was shown even if there was no nomineed. (This is only an issue for RPGs who upgraded from SMS.)
- The Enterprise-era (ENT) genre install file had several issues and typos. ([#155](https://github.com/anodyne/nova/issues/155))
- The database automatically set a default rank for pending users potentially resulting in some confusion as to why a pending user already has a rank. ([#148](https://github.com/anodyne/nova/issues/148))
- If there is only one specification item, the list of items would be dispalyed instead of automatically sending the user to the only specification item. ([#146](https://github.com/anodyne/nova/issues/146))
- If there is only one specification item, the list of decks would be dispalyed instead of automatically sending the user to the only deck listing. ([#147](https://github.com/anodyne/nova/issues/147))
- During fresh installs, the user ID constraint wasn't consistent with the rest of the user ID fields throughout the system.
- Under some circumstances, users could edit posts they weren't even a part of. (Thanks to evshell18 on the Anodyne forums for pointing this out and getting the ball rolling on a fix.)
